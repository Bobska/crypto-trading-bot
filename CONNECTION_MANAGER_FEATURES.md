# Enhanced ConnectionManager Features

## Overview
Improved WebSocket connection management with heartbeat, intelligent broadcasting, and detailed tracking.

## New Features

### 1. Heartbeat Mechanism (30s intervals)
```python
async def send_heartbeat():
    """Keeps connections alive, auto-removes dead connections"""
    - Sends ping every 30 seconds
    - Automatically detects and removes dead connections
    - Prevents proxy/firewall timeouts
    - Logs: "💓 Heartbeat sent to X clients"
```

**Benefits:**
- Connections stay alive through NAT/firewalls
- Dead connections cleaned up automatically
- No manual connection health checks needed

### 2. Connection Tracking

Each connection tracks:
- `connected_at` - Connection timestamp
- `messages_sent` - Total messages sent to this client
- `last_activity` - Last successful message time

**On disconnect, logs:**
```
❌ WebSocket disconnected after 123.4s. Messages sent: 45. Remaining: 2
```

### 3. Specialized Broadcast Methods

#### broadcast_trade(trade_data)
Formats trade notifications with:
- Emoji: 🟢 BUY, 🔴 SELL
- Formatted price: `$45,000.00`
- Human-readable message: "🟢 BUY 0.01 BTC at $45,000.00"
- Timestamp in ISO format
- All trade details (profit_pct, position, etc.)

**Example:**
```python
await manager.broadcast_trade({
    'action': 'BUY',
    'price': 45000,
    'amount': 0.01,
    'position': 'LONG',
    'profit_pct': 2.5
})
```

**Log output:**
```
💰 Trade broadcast: BUY at $45,000.00
📡 Broadcast to 2 clients: trade_executed
```

#### broadcast_price(price_data)
Smart price broadcasting:
- **Only broadcasts if price changed >0.1%**
- Prevents spam from minor fluctuations
- Formats price nicely: `$45,123.45`
- Tracks `last_price` to calculate change

**Example:**
```python
await manager.broadcast_price({
    'price': 45050,
    'symbol': 'BTC/USDT'
})
# Only broadcasts if price moved >$45 (0.1% of 45000)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic
- Only sends meaningful updates
- Keeps bandwidth usage low

#### broadcast_status(status_data)
Formats bot status changes:
- Status: running/stopped
- Position: LONG/SHORT/NONE
- Balance: BTC/USDT amounts
- `bot_running` boolean flag

**Example:**
```python
await manager.broadcast_status({
    'status': 'running',
    'position': 'LONG',
    'balance': {'BTC': 0.01, 'USDT': 1000}
})
```

**Log output:**
```
⚡ Status broadcast: RUNNING
📡 Broadcast to 2 clients: status_change
```

### 4. Connection Statistics

#### GET /api/connections
Returns detailed stats about all connections:

```json
{
  "total_connections": 2,
  "connections": [
    {
      "connected_for": "123.4s",
      "messages_sent": 45,
      "last_activity": "2025-10-24T10:30:45.123456"
    },
    {
      "connected_for": "67.8s",
      "messages_sent": 23,
      "last_activity": "2025-10-24T10:30:44.987654"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Monitor connection health
- Debug connection issues
- Track client activity
- Identify idle connections

### 5. Updated bot.py Integration

Bot now uses specialized methods automatically:

```python
# In bot.py _broadcast_update():
if message_type == 'trade_executed':
    asyncio.run(manager.broadcast_trade(data))
elif message_type == 'price_update':
    asyncio.run(manager.broadcast_price(data))
elif message_type == 'status_change':
    asyncio.run(manager.broadcast_status(data))
```

**Benefits:**
- Better formatting automatically
- Intelligent filtering (price changes)
- Consistent emoji usage
- Cleaner logs

## Testing

### Test Heartbeat
1. Start bot_api: `python bot_api.py`
2. Connect WebSocket client
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check console: `💓 Heartbeat sent to 1 clients`

### Test Smart Price Broadcasting
```python
# Price change < 0.1% - NOT broadcasted
await manager.broadcast_price({'price': 45001, 'symbol': 'BTC/USDT'})

# Price change > 0.1% - IS broadcasted  
await manager.broadcast_price({'price': 45100, 'symbol': 'BTC/USDT'})
```

### Test Connection Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/api/connections
```

### Test Trade Broadcasting
Watch console when bot executes trade:
```
💰 Trade broadcast: BUY at $45,000.00
📡 Broadcast to 2 clients: trade_executed
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- All price updates broadcasted (even 0.01% changes)
- No heartbeat - connections die after 60s idle
- No connection tracking
- Generic broadcast logging

### After:
- Only significant price changes (>0.1%) broadcasted
- Heartbeat keeps connections alive indefinitely
- Detailed per-connection statistics
- Specialized logs per message type

### Bandwidth Savings:
If price updates every 1 second:
- **Before:** 60 updates/minute
- **After:** ~6 updates/minute (only >0.1% changes)
- **Savings:** 90% reduction in price update traffic

## Log Examples
