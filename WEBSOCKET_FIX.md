# WebSocket Fix - Testing Instructions

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Duplicate WebSocket Endpoint Removed
- **Problem**: Two /ws endpoints defined at different locations
- **Solution**: Removed the first endpoint (line ~506), kept the enhanced one (line ~1108)

### 2. WebSocket Connection Keepalive
- **Problem**: Connection died after inactivity, no keepalive mechanism
- **Solution**: Added syncio.wait_for() with 60-second timeout
  - Every 60 seconds without client messages, server sends heartbeat
  - Detects dead connections and closes them gracefully
  - Infinite while True loop keeps connection open

### 3. API Timeout Protection
- **Problem**: get_status() blocked on slow exchange API calls
- **Solution**: Added 2-second timeout with fallback to cached data
  - Runs exchange calls in thread pool (non-blocking)
  - Falls back to state file if exchange times out
  - Frontend gets response within timeout window

## How to Test

1. **Stop all services**:
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Name "redis-server","python","cmd" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
   ```

2. **Start the backend**:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\dev-projects\crypto-trading-bot
   python bot_api.py
   ```

3. **In another terminal, start the frontend**:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\dev-projects\crypto_bot_ui
   .\START_ALL_ENHANCED.ps1
   ```

4. **Open browser and check**:
   - Go to http://localhost:8000 (or your dashboard URL)
   - Watch browser console for connection status
   - Should see: ✅ WebSocket connected - LIVE UPDATES ENABLED
   - Should see: 💓 Sent keepalive heartbeat in backend logs every 60s

5. **Monitor for timeouts**:
   - Keep dashboard open for 2-3 minutes
   - Price indicator should stay GREEN
   - No "signal timed out" errors
   - Backend logs should show heartbeats

## Expected Behavior

✅ **WebSocket stays connected indefinitely**
✅ **Heartbeats sent every 60 seconds** (visible in backend logs)
✅ **Price updates continue flowing** (indicator stays green)
✅ **No timeout errors in console**
✅ **API responds quickly** (< 3 seconds)

## If Issues Persist

1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
3. Test API directly:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8002/api/status" | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```
4. Check if exchange API is reachable
5. Verify Redis is running (if required)

---
**Note**: The backend must stay running continuously. If it crashes or stops, WebSocket will disconnect.
